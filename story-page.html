    <h2 class="blathers">Last Thursday</h2>

    <p>Dear Will,</p>
    <p>I never wrote one of these before. Not quite sure on how to start. Maybe the question is “where to start?”</p>
    <p>	So last Thursday while I was working at the Jiffy Lube, this guy in a hood walks in with a gun. It wasn’t real obvious that it was a gun at first. I thought he was holding a drink. You know, like a mug full of orange juice or what not. So I did not pay much mind to it until I smelled my manager. He has this thick heavy cologne he gets imported from his home in Russia. Smells like a cigarette smoked a pipe filled with burnt charcoal. Anyways, I usually have one headphone stuck in my left ear. The sound doesn’t work on the right one. When the smell becomes too overwhelming I realized he came behind the counter to me. I look to my right to see if he was there because that’s the only entrance to behind the counter but he wasn’t there. He’s on my left, somehow, and takes my headphone out and says</p>
    <p>	“Phil, you see that guy in the aisle over there.”</p>
    <p>	I say yeah.</p>
    <p>	“What do you think he got in his hands.”</p>
    <p>	What the OJ? I respond.</p>
    <p>	“OJ? No-What? I think he’s got a gun.”</p>
    <p>	My heart drops. I ask if he was sure but before he could respond, the guy in the hood walks up. He pulls out the tool from his side and asks us to open the register. I have my hands up at this point because I have never been held up before. I look over to my right and find my manager’s hands at his side, confidently standing there with a smirk that bends through his thick grey mustache. He lets out a laugh and tells him to do it. The guy in the hood and I both get taken aback by this. There’s a loud silence in the room after that was said. So loud, you can hear the tune of “Pockets” by Smokepurpp bleed out from the headphone hanging down my shirt like a hoodie string.</p>
    <p>	“Wha-What” says the guy who’s sticking us up.</p>
    <p>	“You heard me,” my manager says as puts his hands on the counter and leans closer.</p>
    <p>	The guy puts the gun down and takes his hood down. “Hey man I just need some money. The gun’s kind of just a scare tactic. I’m not out here tryna kill nobody.”</p>
    <p>	My manager seemed to have a moment of realization as he stresses the word “Oh” for a minute long. I didn’t catch the sarcasm though until he followed up by saying “I didn’t realize you were a girl.” It was a dude under the hood. The guy gets a face as if he’s holding in a fart. At that moment of confusion, my manager reaches over the counter for the guy’s gun. He quickly swipes it from him. Now he’s got it pointed at the guy. The guy quickly puts his hands up and as his voice goes up a few pitches he says “Woah man take it easy.”</p>
    <p>	My manager is now in a position of power and he knows it. He’s smugly waving the gun around in the guy’s face, yelling at him for disrespecting his store. I wasn’t quite sure if whether or not my manager was going to let the guy go or shoot him. The guy started pleading for his life, begging for a shot of redemption and looking for mercy within the eyes of my manager. My manager smiles and cocks the gun’s hammer back and asks “any last words.” The guy looks up now with a totally different expression on his face, almost similar to the one my manager had earlier. The guy says “Do it.” My manager pulls the trigger and you hear a “click.” The clip’s empty.</p>
    <p>	The guy’s face stays the same but my manager’s radically changes. Before anything else could happen, the guy lunges forward with a knife and stabs my manager in the neck. In one quick motion he swipes right like how I would do with my headphone if I got bored of listening music in my left ear and wanted to hear some in my right ear.</p>
    <p>	My manager drops to the floor and starts to create a pool of blood on himself. I’m quivering and have pissed my pants at this point. I got tears running down my face, snot chasing it, and piss beating it all as it leads down my leg.. The guy with the hood looks at me, smiles, and says: “Hey, I’m Claudius, a bandit. Your dead friend over here, yeah big tax evasion guy. Huge scammer, been scamming this place for years. My boss just gave me a tip to come check this lowlife out.” </p>
    <p>	He assures me that my manager was his only target and that it’s all over now. That my life isn’t in danger anymore. As if, I should just pretend like the last thirty minutes of my life didn’t happen. Right before he leaves, he grabs a bottle of soda and places it down on the counter. He asks “how much for this?” It takes me a second to come back to reality and once I do I scramble my mind to find a number. I say the first one that comes in mind, “uhm, 6?” He looks through his wallet for what seemed like an hour. He look at me and says “I got no change, so here’s a fifty, keep the change for your troubles.” He then walks out. He paid. He really paid.</p>
    <p>	So yeah, I don’t know how wills normally go but thats why I wanted to write this. To get the ball rolling and start one You never know when your last day going to be. Mine was almost last thursday, my manager’s was, in fact, last thursday.</p>

    <h2 class="blathers">Deadman’s Wonderland</h2>

    <p>When drowning in the abyss of my thoughts, only a drive helps clear my head. These drives can last as long as hours, once lasting as long as a day. I never really notice though, which explains how I let years pass me by, as if each year was merely just another sign on the road. With a mind that gains nothing but joy from dredging up my darkest thoughts out from the crevices of my psyche, I fear what will be next that comes to light to haunt me. That’s where my beautiful Toyota Camry comes in. The insides are riddled with the smell of an old aquarium mixed with the pungent stench the ashtray filled with cigarette buds omits has become my oxygen while the song “im blue” by Eiffel 65 is on repeat. These drives serve as a form of therapy for me; some have cigarettes, others have pottery, while I have drives down Route 20. These drives usually end up nowhere but the destination was never something I was worried about. It was the drive what really counts.
    </p>
    <p>	The gaslight has been blinking for about 10 minutes now, and with the only service stop that I’ve seen in miles coming up on the right, I think it's about time to make quick pit stop. I turn into the second lane right behind an RV. I pop the fuel tank, put the hose in and let it pump. I walk over inside the booth where no cashier is in attendance. I wait for a few seconds until a man with a hood walks in. I’m caught off guard to how big this man is. At least 7 feet tall and double for the width, I swallowed my words like it was a piece of gum I have been chewing for half a day. Finally I say, “Uhm $20 on the pump 4 please.”</p>
    <p>	“Excuse me,” the man slowly mutters through his hotdog sized lips. I scramble to find the right rebuttal. I’m confused as to how a gas station cashier is baffled by what I just said. He stares at me as I nervously avoid making eye contacting while still looking at me. Right then, I hear the door creak behind me. I look behind to catch a glimpse of hair as red as velvet cake. Before I even get a chance to see her face, my mind starts doing that thing it starts searching. That hair, I’ve seen hair as red as that before. It was Sam’s hair color. But this was not Sam. But that did not matter, cause before I knew it, there it was Sam’s face on that girl’s face. My mind must be playing tricks on me again. Not only is it impossible for Sam to be here, but for her to see me and not trying to rip my head off my body is just unrealistic, especially after what I did. </p>
    <p>	“I got this Pablo, how much did you say on 4 again?” The girl with Sam’s face said as she walked behind the cash register. I hold the twenty bill in my hand with my mouth stuck in this half-open but half-closed position. Its like I was frozen in time. I throw the money over the counter and burst the doors open, dreading every second that came before as it repeats over and over in my head. I jump in my car and rip the key in the ignition. I fly off into the distance.</p>
    <p>	“That couldn’t have been Sam” I keep saying to myself as I attempt to calm down. I try to drive faster to maybe bring focus somewhere else in mind, but it works to no end. So I slow down, and try to go to my place. Than I open my eyes, I look over my right shoulder and she's staring out the window. I swear she looks like shes on the way to the gala even though she contests in saying how hideous she appears. I find that really funny, especially considering that I am in sweats and an old hoodie at the moment. “Tia, I-”</p>
    <p>“Happy Birthday” she interjects. We both laugh knowing full well it was not my birthday but I get it, people have a tendency to fill awkward silences.</p>
    <p>	I look at her and wonder whether this is a daydream or not. But I don’t think it matters. Her presence, whether its real or not, is soothing. “ I grip the wheel tighter as I fiddle with the music. “Well I guess there isn’t much else to talk about besides the fact that you won’t answer my question” she enthusiastically boasts. “Question, what question are you referring to?” I say as I pretend to not know the question. “Oh my god Mick, your so annoying” she sarcastically whines. “Can you just tell me and stop pretending to be dumb” she grunts.</p>
    <p>	We both immediately respond with “Who says I’m pretending,” with hers being more of an impression than an actual response and mine coming from a place of cheap jokes and half-baked punchlines.</p>
    <p>	“Wow. Gottem. You sadly become too predictable,” she says as we both share a laugh.</p>
    <p>As I become more comfortable I notice my hands slipping. I look at her and ask to grab the wheel for me. She looks back in confusion. “What’s wrong with your hands.” I look forward without answering. Thinking back to Sam. Than back to Tia. Than I see what seems like her hand grab the wheel but then it disappears. In a flash, the wheel is turned and my car flips in mid air. Flying through the air like a bird, my car does three 180 degree flips until it lands on its side in a cold ditch. </p>
    <p>	Minutes after the crash, I wake up to the flames dancing around me as they engulf my car. I look out my right shoulder again to find her gone. Than I look forward and I see into the far distance a women staring back at me for a quick second. She notices me and I notice her and after a moment of eye contact, she looks forward as she starts to walk. I wonder to myself if she looked back or not as I sit in the fiery depths of my car waiting for the inevitable.</p>

    <h2 class="blathers">Afternoon Delight</h2>

    <p>Early mornings seem to be the hardest. Trying to recover from all the shit I saw last night only to go back into it again. I find it hard to be who I was before. The guy who would watch The Walking Dead every sunday night religiously. The guy who could chug 5 beers in a row and then sing the national anthem backwards. The guy who would see his children on a regular basis. I can’t be that guy right now. My work is a never ending battle. New mysteries arise everyday and my team and I are the ones who are equipped to investigate them. I am Detective Gary Ambassador and I am an officer for the Los Angeles Police Department or LAPD for short.</p>
    <p>My partner, Detective Chuck, parks up right on my driveway. He has a bagel in one hand and a coffee in another. He feels that we should strive away from the old cop stereotype of donuts and lazily cruising around. I think he’s just using that as an excuse to get back into shape. Chuck let himself go a bit after he got married. Now that he’s divorced, his old personality traits are starting to resurface. For instance, every morning now he’s trying to get us to jog to work. “Gary, I think today’s the day”.</p>
    <p>“No, Chuck. Sit your ass back in the car and put it back in start.” I look to my left and see the school bus coming around the corner. Then all of a sudden there’s a slam of my house front door. My kids start to rush out.  Some of them barely notice me, while my youngest catches me and gives me a big warm hug whispering “I love you” under her breathe before she leaves for school. </p>
    <p>Chuck pears back on my shoulder. “Sooo, about that jog.” I give him a long stare from the corner of my eyes until I yank the keys right from his hand.</p>
    <p>We don’t get to spend much time in the office today. Usually it’s a bunch of paperwork and formalities but today, we got a crime scene to check out. An unusual report was called in last night. Our captain warns us about what we’re going to see. How it isn’t for the faint of heart. I’ve seen a lot of horrors in my day and I know my captain has had his fair share of witnessing them too. So I’m afraid to say that I got a bit worried when I saw the look on my captain’s face. It’s as if he saw the boogie man. </p>
    <p>Chuck and I arrived to the scene. The household is a small compact apartment. While walking in, the place seemed normal at first. We past by the kitchen as Chuck made comments about how much fiber there was in this person’s pantry. We make our ways to the bathroom, the real crime scene. That’s when we saw it. A single body laying in her own blood on the floor, expressionless, like a porcelain mannequin on a bed of cherokee roses. Her body was still marinating in death but her soul still remained intact it seemed. Through the glimmer of her eyes, it seemed like whatever was left that witnessed this unspeakable horror had faded away not too long ago. Leaving the body behind like a gift card among an arrangements of wrapped gifts. I couldn’t look too long. I made my way out of the room as I saw one of the forensic analysis. I ask him what had happened, however, I was not prepared to hear the horrific unreal phenomenon that happened to this poor young woman.</p>
    <p>I digest it. I have to for the report. I sluggishly walk out the house. Chuck follows expressing his theories on what might’ve happened.</p>
    <p>“You think it was a ghost? I mean I know it sounds crazy but what else might it be.” he says.</p>
    <p>	I give him a look as if he crazy. He shrugs it off while racking his brain for more possibilities.</p>
    <p>“Maybe it was some type of extra terrestrial visiting and they had to see the extent at which-”</p>
    <p>“Extra what,” I interject.</p>
    <p>He starts to laugh. “Forget it, I’m never going to get it.”</p>
    <p>I don’t blame him for his curiosity. We left that monstrosity with no answers. No leads. The women lived by herself and her neighbors didn’t hear or see anyone come in through the night. The other team is following up with intermediate family but what use is that. What happened there isn’t going to be easy to tell her family. </p>
    <p>As I enter the building I look for the captain. I walk into his quarters and sit down in front of his desk.</p>
    <p>	“So, it’s safe for me to assume you got a chance to see the crime scene,” he says.</p>
    <p>	“Yes sir I did.”</p>
    <p>	“And?” he asks.</p>
    <p>	“It’s something like I’ve never seen before,” I reluctantly say to him.</p>
    <p>	“Walk me through it.”</p>
    <p>	I look up at him and right back down. I take a moment to gather myself. I exhale and begin to explain what I saw. “Sir, uhm, are you familiar with mechanical toothbrushes.”</p>
    <p>	“Yes, why do you ask?” he says.</p>
    <p>“Well, it seems as though, that something came over the victim. Whether it be a form of threat or maybe she was drugged. The forensics department are testing her body to see if she was or not.”</p>
    <p>“Ok. And?”</p>
    <p>“And so something must’ve came over her. To posse her. To well, uhm, how can I put this gently. Something possessed her to place the toothbrush in her butthole and turn it on.”</p>
    <p>“Wh-Oh-Ok?”</p>
    <p>“Yeah and she had it on and kept- Well she kept inserting it which might’ve ruptured a blood vessel. After the rupture, she sort of bled out. With the toothbrush still on.” I look my head back down trying to find some more words to say. I am at a lose though.</p>
    <p>	“I-I see. Wow, it’s worse than I thought. What-uh-what do you think it might’ve been.”</p>
    <p>	I laugh as I say “Well Chuck thinks it might’ve been a ghost or an alien maybe.”</p>
    <p>	“Seriously Gary?” he asks.</p>
    <p>	“That’s what Chuck thinks. Personally, I don’t know, maybe it was self inflection,” I say.</p>
    <p>	“Self inflection?” he asks.</p>
    <p>	“Or self pleasure. All I’m trying to say is maybe she did this to herself.”</p>
    <p>	“Why do you think that is?”</p>
    <p>I think long and hard. For why that might be the reason but honestly it sounds as crazy as the aliens idea. I look at my captain and shrug. He tells me that it is okay and to go home with my family. That it had been a long day and I deserved it. I couldn’t argue with that.</p>
    <p>Everything was a blur from there on out. The banter with Chuck as we walked out. The car ride home. Until I get inside. I see all my kids bundled up watching Elmo on the television. </p>
    <p>	Everything was a blur from there on out. The banter with Chuck as we walked out. The car ride home. Until I get inside. I see all my kids bundled up watching Elmo on the television. My heart warms up as I crept into the living room, not trying to wake them. I slip right in the middle of them. Most of them are asleep. All except the youngest. She looks at me and smiles. Then she asks “How was work today daddy?”</p>
    <p>I smile, deciding to shelter her from the burden of the horror I was caught up today. “It was fine honey.”</p>
    <p>	She smiles and gives me a tight hug. I smile back as I slide comfortably into the seat cushion while watching Elmo count to the number ten.</p>





    <img src="images/drift.jpg" height="250" alt="let me out here pls">
    <h2 class="blathers">An Uber Ride In The City</h2>

    <p>In and out of consciousness, I find myself deliciously so drunk to the point where I’m holding onto this chicken handle in the back of this Uber for the life of me. I look down to see that my dress has small stains. I look over to my right and see an even bigger stain, my date, a complete mess. I overhear some yelling in the front seat, I lean in to make it out.</p>
    <p>“Where’s the drink? Huh? Where’s the drink? You really expect her to eat without a drink? After a long day of playing in the sandbox and what not. If I was her, I would throw that food back up and spit it back at you too, c’mon Linda you’re smarter than that. Linda, please-”</p>
    <p>He turns the corner, the gravity pushes my body back into the car door. My face plants on the door while I’m holding onto whatever source of life I have left.</p>
    <p>“So big fun party night right?”</p>
    <p>My mind is fried, not sure if he was speaking to me or not. My mouth wired shut so I sit there with my eyes too low to see anything.</p>
    <p>“Yeah, I love clubs too. I went to downtown the other night. Or maybe it was Koreatown. Anyways, I managed to meet Drake Bell, true story. If you give me your number I can send you a picture of where he autographed me.”</p>
    <p>I slide back down my seat. It’s hard to understand what he’s trying to saying. He's now either asking me about my bra size or about my car tires. Regardless, I shake my head up and down in compliance with my eyes closed, barely gripping onto whatever is left of my life.</p>
    <p>"You know if you feel like throwing up let me know. I can pull over and you can let all that out. Matter of fact, take this plastic bag."</p>
    <p>His phone begins to ring. He looks at it and sighs in hesitation. He puts it down.</p>
    <p>"Problems are always knocking at the door am I right?"</p>
    <p>His phone begins to ring again. He answers this time. "Collin, my man, Jesus I haven’t heard from you since Padman kicked us out. Yeah, I can swing by your place after I do this last trip buddy. Make sure you turn the thermostat off this time.” He begins to laugh out loud.</p>
    <p>His laughter bolsters through my dreams and starts to hurt my head. My stomach starts turning after his driving becomes as erratic as his laughter. I fight the urge that’s pounding in my stomach I reach for the bag and clench my very soul. At that moment, I open my eyes and the rush goes away. Then I hear it. </p>
    <p>“Oh my goodness, did your boyfriend just puke all over himself. Jesus Christ, I just got this car detailed. I even gave you a plastic bag man. Are you serious.” He pulls over. </p>
    <p>“Alright kids this is as far as I’m taking you. You guys can walk it that extra block.” He opens my door. “Here take my hand.” He helps me out the car and brings me my stuff.</p>
    <p>He opens my date’s door. “Get out you miserable sack of nuts! I swear if I get a single flake of vomit on me I swear I am just going to break down here and cry. Okay miss, here’s the carcass of your boyfriend, I hope you two get home safely and if you ever need a ride again here's my business card.</p>
    <p>He hands me a napkin with his number written in lipstick. He gets into his car and starts blasting some foreign music. He speeds off into the night with one look back to us and then right back to the road in front of him. </p>
